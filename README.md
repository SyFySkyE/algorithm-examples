# Why hello there!

This repo is where I plan to start exploring algoirthms and studying their efficiencies. I will also use this space for good (and bad) examples, explain why and how to improve them!

### Recent Progress
9/16: Added notepad with examples from the .sln, removing boilerplate C#. Added comments to both .sln and notepad.
9/14: Added C# .sln file with examples using the Big O notation. This can be found under the Algorithms/ folder.
